# scribus-import-text-script
A Python script that imports a text file (e.g. ODT) into a given text frame

I'm looking for a script that does this (hopefully) simple action. Given the name of a Scribus file, the name of a text frame, and the name of an OpenOffice document, the script imports the ODT file into that frame. So it might work something like this:

import-text.py essays.sla, backstories, theseus.odt

I have no experience with Python and this isn't a good time for me to learn it, so I'm posting a bounty for this project.
